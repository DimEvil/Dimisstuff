#Platform Lifewatch contribution summary

##How should the platform contribute to LIFEWATCH?
-----
###The Platform  `can act as the National Lifewatch NODE`

If the structure of Lifewatch foresees in national nodes for Lifewatch, focal points or similar organs in it's legal structure, the platform can take up this role. A lifewatch node could work rather similar than the GBIF node. The node is involved in animating, and promoting a community of Lifewatch data providers in Belgium. The node facilitates the publication of Lifewatch related datatypes.

This moment, there is no infrastructure for that. but it 's the goal of Lifewatch to build this infrastructure. (Should be).

###The Platform  `organizes a conference on Biodiversity e-infrastructure in Europa`

In 2015 the Platform will organize a conference on the biodiversity e-infrastructures in Europe. The Platform tries with this conference to informe the Belgian Scientific Community on what happened `is happening`  during the last few years on biodiversity informatics in EU and Belgium. Key players for this conference are off course Lifewatch, EU BON, Pro I Biosphere,.... and GBIF.


### The Platform `will ask more information on it's possible role for Lifewatch`

During the meeting we will have on April 4th, the Platform will ask the Lifewatch community on what other roles they would/could have in mind for the Belgian Biodiversity Platform. If we see the added value for Lifewatch/The Platform/ Belgian Biodiversity community we could take up another role, if feasible.  

  
### Conclusion

It is clear that `The Role Of the Platform` in Lifewatch is stronly dependant on ERIC and what Lifewatch will become. The Platform is willing to take up an active role for Lifewatch, when this will have an added value for the project, the community and the Platform (by example National Lifewatch Node). In the meantime we will start soon enough with the preparation of the e-infrastructure conference by creating a `taskforce` during the next CM. Other tasks for the platform can be defined during the meeting, on request by the existing Lifewatch community in Belgium (Vliz, INBO, UcL,....)

### outcomes of the meeting

The platform can help in providing content to lifewatch.be, as can the other Belgian lifewatch partners.


###Action Points

##

Accounts for dms lifewatch.be
Redesign the lifewatch.be webstite

National node role: wait for the Eric (service centre)

being inclusive --> 
The platfrom as the "national service centre"

Taxonomical backbone! Check what the museum does....

regular meeting on technical issues & communication

E-infrasctructure meeting (go)

Ucl --> networkbuilding (find persons create a network...)

###next meeting on the conference.
