#Platform Lifewatch contribution summary

##How should the platform contribute to LIFEWATCH?

###The Platform  `can act as the National Lifewatch NODE`

If the structure of Lifewatch foresees in national nodes for Lifewatch, focal points or similar organs in it's legal structure, the platform can take up this role. A lifewatch node could work rather similar than the GBIF node. The node is involved in animating, and promoting a community of Lifewatch data providers in Belgium. The node facilitates the publication of Lifewatch related datatypes.

This moment, there is no infrastructure for that. but it 's the goal of Lifewatch to build this infrastructure. (Should be).

###The Platform  `organizes a conference on Biodiversity e-infrastructure in Europa`

In 2015 the Platform will organize a conference on the biodiversity e-infrastructures in Europe. The Platform tries with this conference to informe the Belgian Scientific Community on what happened `is happening`  during the last few years on biodiversity informatics in EU and Belgium. Key players for this conference are off course Lifewatch, EU BON, Pro I Biosphere,.... and GBIF.


### The Platform `will ask more information on it's possibel role for Lifewatch`

During the meeting we will have on April 4th, the Platform will ask the Lifewatch community on what other roles they would/could have in mind for the Belgian Biodiversity Platform.
