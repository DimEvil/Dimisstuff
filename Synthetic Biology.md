#Synthetic Biology

##Towards a Belgian Position

(BBPF, ISPWIV, Belspo, BCCM)

##meeting @Belspo

The Platform would like to setup a consultation round on this topic.

### History of the topic

Call for information from SUBSTTA after COP10, this was found insufficient. After a round with consultants a document was send out and commented on by Biosafety and many others. Comments will be incorporated and recomendations. This document is the one we shoudl work with.
Synthetic biology is also floating under the Catagena protocol and also on the Nagoya protocol (which is not so relevant to us)

## EU call

Working group on SB, started in October. 3 scientific committees. Health risks, emerging health risk, risk for consumers. The have a mandate:
Working groups will create 3 opinions on it. What should be the operational definition on SB. Working group on what is SB. In October the WG started. What is the definition of SB.


The recomendations might be the most important to comment on.

### Vilm meeting
The *VILM meeting* is an Europe Expert meeting, who formulates the first sugestions for conclusions for SUBSTTA.
No national positions are defended during VILM, but there are only 2 experts per Country represented. A minor influency of policy is there. There is about 1,5 month between VILM and SUBSTTA.
