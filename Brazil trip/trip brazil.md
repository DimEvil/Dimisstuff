Leaving from Ilhabela (to check there)




Ilhabela is called "the capital of sailing'" for good reason, as the the calm waters and strong winds between the main island and the continent are perfect for nautical sports such as sailing, kitesurf and windsurf
Rolex International Sailing Week, [1]. The largest sailing competition of Latin America, gathering around 1,500 participants. It happens during the winter (july). 

The calm waters are naturally also adequate for swimming. Snorkelling is possible at various beaches. Surfing is best at the beaches not facing the continent, with stronger waves. There is a large number of places indicated for scuba diving, including the smaller islands
Cabras island, (2 km south of ferry boat). Relatively close to the ferry, the island is great for scuba driving due to its diverse fauna.  edit
Various sunken boats can be found around the islands. The oldest dates from 1840 and is near Praia dos Castelhanos, in the east coast. The most famous is the luxurious transatlantic Príncipe das Astúrias', which sank in 1916, causing the death of 450 people. It is located close to Ponta da Pirabura.
Inside the island, trekking, mountain biking and rally (with a jeep), shall give plenty of adventure for those who seek it. A popular choice for mountain biking and rally is the 22 km trail that goes to the Castelhanos beach
For those who want a more relaxed time, an option are the boat rides to remote beaches, fishing spots and the smaller islands
With 300 species of birds, Ilhabela is an important birdwatching spot, considered as an "Important Bird Site for Priority Conservation" by Birdlife International
